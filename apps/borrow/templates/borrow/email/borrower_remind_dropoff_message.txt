 - Let us know if anything is wrong with the bike.
 - Give us a “like” us on Facebook http://www.facebook.com/BikeSurf.org
 - Donate online: http://bikesurf.org/berlin/donate

Give any donation you can afford to help maintain this. It costs us approximately 0.50€ per day to maintain each bike. Unfortunately not everyone can afford to donate, so please be generous.

Sincerely,
The team at BikeSurf
