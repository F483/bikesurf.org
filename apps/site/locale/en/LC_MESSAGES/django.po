"BikeSurf.org is a open-source platform for anybody to set up their own "
"BikeSurf project in their local neighbourhood. The project has been running "
"successfully since June 2012. Eventually, the idea will spread all around "
"the world. By working under the one website, it reduces the time spent "
"developing the web tools and increases the profile of the initiative.\n"
"<br><br>\n"
"All the BikeSurf projects are operated independently, with their own "
"financial, logistics and policy controls.\n"
"<br><br>\n"
"The BikeSurf philosophy seeks to allow people the chance to appreciate the "
"world from a saddle: going green, healthy and cheap. There is also the more "
"intangible  social value of the project. Such sharing projects encourage "
"people to communicate, share resources and develop a stronger sense of "
"community."
