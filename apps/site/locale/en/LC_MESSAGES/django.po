"It all started in Berlin, frustrated with the lack of resources for bikers, "
"Graham Pope and Pau Simo thought up an ingenious brain child that would "
"become the world’s first bike sharing service. Inspired by services such as "
"CouchSurfing and BeWelcome, Graham and Pau wanted to create a service for "
"people in Berlin that enabled more people to experience the joys of biking "
"in such a bike friendly city as Berlin. With just a rudimentary booking "
"system and three bikes to begin with, Graham and Pau set to work and by June "
"of 2012 the first bike surfer set to the streets of Berlin.\n"
"</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>\n"
"Since then, over six hundred people have used the BikeSurfing service. The "
"two man team has since expanded to ten volunteers that dedicate their time "
"and skills to making this project the best it can be. \n"
"</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>\n"
"Our passion lies in biking, bike culture, and a desire to help our fellow "
"man and make the world a better place. Our goals for the project include:\n"
"<ul> \n"
"<li>allow everyone to experience cycling in a bike-friendly city "
"environment</li>\n"
"<li>demonstrate that a trust-based system is viable</li>\n"
"<li>reduce waste by repairing used bikes</li>\n"
"<li>create a cycling access point for information about bikes and biking, "
"especially for people visiting Berlin</li>\n"
"<li>reduce the stolen bike market by advising where to buy from reliable "
"sources</li>\n"
"<li>encourage the growth of our community in Berlin and beyond</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>\n"
"We are excited and honored to have had such a warm response from the "
"community. BikeSurf has grown beyond our expectations and we continue to "
"work hard to make it the best it can be. Thank you for your interest and "
"support! \n"
