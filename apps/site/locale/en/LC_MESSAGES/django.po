"BikeSurf is a project to provide anyone with the best, ecological and healthy means of transportation in any city around the world - the bike.\n"
"<br><br>\n"
"We believe that cycling has the potential to change the way people think about and interact with their environment. Having the opportunity to get a free (or cheap) rental bike will allow people to fall in love with biking in an urban environment all over again. The sharing aspect of the project allows the maximum number of people to benefit from the bikes the project provides and can be applied to many other items using a similar model.\n"
"<br><br>\n"
"How the bicycle request system works is demonstrated in this video. If you are a supporter of our cause and you want to be involved, look below to make a donation or start a team of your own!\n"

"It began in Berlin...\n"
"\n"
"Back in May 2012, Graham Pope and Pau Simo were interested in creating a bike sharing system that was not based on money but on karma, trust and community. \n"
"<br><br>\n"
"With limited resources they developed a centrally-run free system, that would allow anyone to borrow a bike. They had previous hospitality club (eg couchsurfing) experience and imagined that using a similar trust system would work even in a skeptical and capitalist world.They established a website and developed a rudimentary booking system for three bikes they had donated or received from others. On 15th June 2012, the first BikeSurfBerlin (BSB) bike was lent to its first BikeSurfer...\n"
"<br><br>\n"
"Since that time BikeSurfBerlin has lent bikes to nearly 1000 BikeSurfers. The BSB Team has increased to over ten active members who dedicate their time and skills to running and developing the project.\n"
"<br><br>\n"
"The BikeSurf philosophy seeks to allow people the chance to appreciate the world from a saddle: going green, healthy and cheap. There is also the more intangible  social value of the project. Such sharing projects encourage people to communicate, share resources and develop a stronger sense of community."
