"BikeSurf is a project to provide anyone with the best, ecological and "
"healthy means of transportation in any city around the world - the bike.\n"
"<br><br>\n"
"We believe that cycling has the potential to change the way people think "
"about and interact with their environment. Having the opportunity to get a "
"free (or cheap) rental bike will allow people to fall in love with biking in "
"an urban environment all over again. The sharing aspect of the project "
"allows the maximum number of people to benefit from the bikes the project "
"provides and can be applied to many other items using a similar model.\n"
"<br><br>\n"
"How the bicycle request system works is demonstrated in this video. If you "
"are a supporter of our cause and you want to be involved, look below to make "
"a donation or start a team of your own!\n"

"It began in Berlin...\n"
"\n"
"Back in May 2012, Graham Pope and Pau Simo were interested in creating a "
"bike sharing system that was not based on money but on karma, trust and "
"community. \n"
"<br><br>\n"
"With limited resources they developed a centrally-run free system, that "
"would allow anyone to borrow a bike. They had previous hospitality club (eg "
"couchsurfing) experience and imagined that using a similar trust system "
"would work even in a skeptical and capitalist world.They established a "
"website and developed a rudimentary booking system for three bikes they had "
"donated or received from others. On 15th June 2012, the first BikeSurfBerlin "
"(BSB) bike was lent to its first BikeSurfer...\n"
"<br><br>\n"
"Since that time BikeSurfBerlin has lent bikes to nearly 1000 BikeSurfers. "
"The BSB Team has increased to over ten active members who dedicate their "
"time and skills to running and developing the project.\n"
"<br><br>\n"
"The BikeSurf philosophy seeks to allow people the chance to appreciate the "
"world from a saddle: going green, healthy and cheap. There is also the more "
"intangible  social value of the project. Such sharing projects encourage "
"people to communicate, share resources and develop a stronger sense of "
"community."
